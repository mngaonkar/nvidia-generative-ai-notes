# Nemo Run

Replaces the old “NeMo Framework Launcher”.
It lets you execute NeMo workflows (data prep, training, evaluation) reproducibly, including:
- Local runs
- Slurm cluster
- Distributed training (torchrun)
- Config-driven pipelines

NeMo-Run is integrated with NeMo 2.0 and shipped as part of the toolkit or a separate package.

```
pip install nemorun
```
